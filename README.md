In this project, the first single-cell atlas of alternative transcription start sites of healthy and diabetic retina by using 5′-tag-based single-cell RNA sequencing. We observed that retinal cell types have distinct regulatory elements and transcription factors binding motif activities. Lengthening of 5′- UTRs in retinal cell types are enriched for multiple RNA binding protein binding sites, including splicing regulators *Rbfox1*/*2*/*3* and *Nova1*. Our work provides a comprehensive panorama of alternative TSS and its potential consequence related to post-transcriptional regulation, which may provide insights into cellular heterogeneity driven by transcriptional initiation and open up the perspectives for identification of novel diagnostic indexes for diabetic retinopathy.
