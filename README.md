## Description
This repository contains the R code related to the publication by [Mao et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014483523001410).

In this project, we  provided the first single-cell atlas of alternative transcription start sites of healthy and diabetic retina by using 5′-tag-based single-cell RNA sequencing. We observed distinct regulatory elements and transcription factors binding motif activities in retinal cell types; multiple RNA binding protein binding sites in Lengthening of 5′- UTRs; and elevated apoptosis signal in Müller glia and microglia. We anticipate our assay can provide insights into cellular heterogeneity driven by transcriptional initiation and open up the perspectives for identification of novel diagnostic indexes for diabetic retinopathy.
